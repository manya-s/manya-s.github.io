				about me
			</div>
			<div id = "abouttext2">
			I am an undergraduate student of physics at IIT Roorkee and an aspiring product designer.
			</div>
			<div id = "abouttext3">
			I love to observe and analyse my surroundings to look for ideas, inspirations or puzzles.
			Once I come across a problem, I can not rest until I find an explanation or a solution for it, which leads to my interest in physics, finding solutions and well, designing. 
			I believe that design is essentially a process of finding solutions for problems irrespective of the nature of the solution.

		<div class = "about_text">
			<div class = "about_img"><img src="about_physics.png"></div>
			I study physics in my undergraduate studies and find many similarities between studying physics and the work I do as a designer since both require a keen sense of curiosity and zeal to find solutions to problems.
		</div>
		<div class = "about_text">
			<div class = "about_img"><img src="about_books.png"></div>
			I am a devourer of books, fiction, non-fiction and everything in between. Whenever I am not working or procrastinating about working, you are most likely to find me with my nose buried in a book.
		</div>
		<div class = "about_text">
			<div class = "about_img"><img src="about_music.png"></div>
			Listening to music helps me calm my nerves and focus better. I listen to music when I am working, reading a book, sleeping or doing pretty much anything else.
		</div>
		<div class = "about_text">
			<div class = "about_img"><img src="about_art.png"></div>
			I have been drawing since I was a little kid and like most kids took art classes. Over time I developed a keen interest in art which motivated me to try design for the first time.
